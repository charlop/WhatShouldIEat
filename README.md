# What Should I Eat Android App

Originally developed for a school project, it provides users with nearby food suggestions which they can Like/Dislike. The app stores the user's like/dislike history and builds a profile of their interests (users can also explicitly set their preferences) for future suggestions.
Users can also suggest new places to be added to the list.

## TODO's
--------------
* Update the UI
* Better suggestion algorithm (e.g. based on time of day, what's currently trending in the area)
* Add more food options
